Friday 8/28 Code Review project

I'm using readme files from now on for communication with code reviewers.

I think I got all the functionality required.  As you can see my dates are wonky in displaying but I know from past experience that date formatting is tricky and, frankly, I just didn't have the energy or time to go down that rabbit hole.  I suspect that javascript tools we will learn will do that easily.  I clearly need to learn more html/css but will save that for a later challenge.
